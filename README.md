## Installation

To install, just run the following Composer command.

```
composer require divineomega/laravel-offensive-validation-rule
```

Please note that this package requires Laravel 5.5 or above.

## Usage

The following code snippet shows an example of how to use the offensive validation rule.

```php
use DivineOmega\LaravelOffensiveValidationRule\Offensive;

$request->validate([
    'username' => ['required', new Offensive],
]);
```

### Custom word lists

If the defaults are too strict (or not strict enough), you can optionally specify a custom list 
of offensive words and custom whitelist. Below is an example of using a custom blacklist and whitelist.

```php
use DivineOmega\LaravelOffensiveValidationRule\Offensive;
use DivineOmega\IsOffensive\OffensiveChecker;

$blacklist = ['moist', 'stinky', 'poo'];
$whitelist = ['poop'];

$request->validate([
    'username' => ['required', new Offensive(new OffensiveChecker($blacklist, $whitelist))],
]);
```
